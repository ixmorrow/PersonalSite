    <p>
      Neptune protocol is a project I joined during the <a href="https://solana.com/riptide">Solana Riptide hackathon</a>. It's a DeFi lending and borrowing protocol
      with lots of new and unique features. Currently, the project is deployed and live on the Solana Devnet, which means the tokens in the protocol do not have any value.
      This is a project that's under active development and our goal is to have it deployed out to Mainnet Q2 or Q3 of 2022. This is the biggest project I have been a part of myself
      and it has been so much fun to work on.

      At the end of the hackathon, our project actually won 3 different tracks! We won the <a href="https://twitter.com/PythNetwork/status/1514621993290805260?s=20&t=fcQytOlEEXy9OHOXoC5-JA">Pyth track</a>,

    <h4 style="color:#EC4646"><a href="https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course">Solana End to End Dev Course</a></h4>
    <p>This is a complete course meant to on-board web developers to development in the Solana ecosystem. I worked with the Solana Foundation
    on this course and it is completely open sourced. I helped write the lessons in this course and also built out the programs that are used throughout the course.
  This was the first time I've ever tried to teach a course or write about technical topics online and I really enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>A project I'm working on to learn the basics of Web3 development. The idea is that you can enter any ERC-20 address and the web app will display
    all of the addresses that have transacted with this node within the last 1,000 blocks and all of the addresses that those nodes have trasnacted with, so on and so forth. I am
  using the Web3.js javascript library to make this.</p>
