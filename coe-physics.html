  <h1>How can we create a neutron detector that can that can fit in a person's hand?</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The detection of neutrons is an indication of nuclear materials, creating significant applications for handheld neutron detectors in homeland security. For this reason, we designed a detector made with glass enriched with 10B and 6Li to give the
    glass a scintillating effect.</p>
  <p>The model is compact enough to be used as a handheld detector and is equipped with machine learning capabilities to determine the location of the source.</p>
  <p>This was a three-month-long research project, which concluded with the successful testing of the detector hardware and software. Following the completion of the project, I helped author a scientific paper that was then published. This research
    project was conducted in conjunction with Penn State University, University of Florida, and Clemson University.</p>
