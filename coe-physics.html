  <h1 class="physics-header">How can we create a neutron detector that can that can fit in a person's hand?</h1>

  <div class="physics-text">
    <p>The detection of neutrons is an indication of nuclear materials, creating significant applications for handheld neutron detectors in homeland security. For this reason, we designed a detector made with glass enriched with 10B and 6Li to give
      the
      glass a scintillating effect.</p>
    <p>The model is compact enough to be used as a handheld detector and is equipped with machine learning capabilities to determine the location of the source.</p>
    <p>This was a three-month-long research project, which concluded with the successful testing of the detector hardware and software. Following the completion of the project, I helped author a scientific paper that was then published. This research
      project was conducted in conjunction with Penn State University, University of Florida, and Clemson University.</p>
