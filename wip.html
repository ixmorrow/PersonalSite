    <h3>Best content of the last week</h3>
    <h4><em>October 6, 2021</em></h4>
    <p>This past weekend, I had about a 5 hour drive from Louislville back to Chicago and I normally spend drives like this catching up on some of my favorite podcasts. This time
      I listened to a few episodes of Deribit's Deep in the Money podcast. This podcast is solely about Crypto Options and the host interviews various different players in the industry. Given
      that I work at a TradFi Options Market Maker, this is an area that interests me greatly. With all that said, I was blown away at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVarCVYWKrw">latest episode with Greg Magadini from Genesis
        Volatility.</a> Please go check
      this out if crypto options are of interest to you, there were a lot of interesting topics discussed in a manner that is easy to understand. I will be giving this episode another listen sometime this week.</p>
    <h3>Life decisions!</h3>
    <h4><em>September 27, 2021</em></h4>
    <p>Anthony Pompliano, otherwise known simply as Pomp, is someone I've discovered within the last year when I firsrt got into the crypto world and he has been one of my favorite follows since!
      Pomp always has some interesting and thought provoking things to say and he definitely knows his stuff when it comes to Bitcoin and investing. Here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1441950536807301126?s=20">thread</a> he
      tweeted the other day about the most important decisions a person makes in their lifetime that I really enjoyed reading, definitely some good advice here.</p>
    <p>also I really enjoyed this tweet I saw the other day from @0xc1a8</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    <h3>In the beginning</h3>
    <h4><em>September 27, 2021</em></h4>
    <p>This page was inspired by the wip on Sean Halpon's personal <a href="https://www.seanhalpin.design/"> website</a> I really enjoyed the idea of an informal personal timeline to keep track of your life.
      Part of what made this so attractive to me is the fact that the updates I post here don't need to be full fledged blog posts and aren't really something I would want to tweet out. I will just use
      this space to air my thoughts out and post updates on projects and/or ideas I'm working on at the time.</p>
