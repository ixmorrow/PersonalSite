        <p>Hello, my name is Ivan. I am a tech and crypto enthuasist interested in investing, FinTech, coding, and sports. I graduated from Coe College
          in May of 2020 with degrees in Physics and Computer Science, where I also played basketball for four years. Currently, I work at Belvedere Trading in Chicago, IL
          as a Trading Systems Analyst. I spend most of my time researching about crypto, writing code, or some athletic activity. I am also an avid reader. I actually created this
          whole webstie from scratch while learning Full-Stack Development!</p>
